* document command line way of deloying using sfx
* clean for web projects
* Make the defaults smart enough to not care about the file extension (should be able to parse from built in properties)
* TeamCity.targets is ugly - needs to know too much about other properties.  Perhaps use ProjectName throughout?
* Allow for an environments file that exists purely for documentation - load at start.
* Allow loading environments to be more pluggable
  * Include EnvironmentFiles.targets for the current way
  * Include EnvironmentsWebService.targets for another way...
* Deployer
  * Show ProjectName in the title bar
  * disable kill icon when process is dead (nead event on SystemProcess)
  * Consider removing dependency on system.xml for boot-up speed
  * Have option to show entire file to prevent security hole (also always save only properties to prevent any additional code from executing)
* Fix templates!
* Just have clients add to @PackageFiles, with metadata to store root dir
* Remove absolute dir refs for scripts in CMDirectory
  * DotNet, Sfx
* Add OnErrorTargets


Environment Strategy:
* move copying environments dir
* move importing file
* splice strategy class for deployer
* move splicing environments dir
